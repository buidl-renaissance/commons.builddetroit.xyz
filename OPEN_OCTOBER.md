# Detroit Open Commons – Open October 2025

## 🎯 Purpose
Open October is a four-week build cycle where Detroit’s creative and technical community comes together to launch and document projects that strengthen the **Detroit Open Commons**.  
We are building open, collaborative systems that reflect values of transparency, accessibility, and permissionless innovation.

---

## 🛠 Structure
- **Curated Projects**: 5 projects, each led by a different community member.  
- **Team Size**: 1–3 core contributors per project, with room for collaborators.  
- **Timeline**:
  - **Kickoff Day** – projects are introduced, goals discussed, teams formed.  
  - **Build Weeks (2–3 weeks)** – async work plus in-person Open Build Days.  
  - **Merge Party** – final presentations, demos, reflections, and celebration.  

---

## 🔍 Project Criteria
Projects should:
- Contribute to the Detroit Open Commons (open source, open data, permissionless).  
- Be scoped to show meaningful progress in a 4-week sprint.  
- Be collaborative, with clear roles for contributors.  
- Allow others to interact with outputs (code, data, designs, documentation).  

**Submission Requirements**:
1. Project name + short description  
2. Problem you are addressing  
3. What you aim to build in 4 weeks  
4. How others can contribute  
5. Links (repos, mockups, references)

## 👥 Participation Expectations
Participation is a commitment to the Commons.  
Each participant is expected to:  
- Attend **Kickoff Day**, **Merge Party**, and at least **one Open Build Day**.  
- Communicate if scheduling conflicts arise (life happens, but ghosting isn’t community).  
- Respect each other’s time, contributions, and pace of learning.  

---

## 📜 Code of Collaboration
All participants and projects agree to:  
- **Openness** – projects contribute back to the Commons.  
- **Respect** – honor time, contributions, and shared goals.  
- **Permissionlessness** – anyone can fork, remix, or extend a project.  
- **Accountability** – non-communication or failure to show up means you won’t be invited back until trust is re-earned.  

---

## 📦 Outcomes
- 5 new Commons-aligned projects initiated.  
- Playbook for future Open Commons build cycles.  
- Momentum for ongoing collaboration in Detroit’s open ecosystem.
