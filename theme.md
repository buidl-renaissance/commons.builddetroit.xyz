# ðŸŽ¨ Detroit's OpenCommons Theme: "Industrial Roots â†’ Solarpunk Future"

## Tone & Energy

- **Grassroots**: Feels community-built, not corporate
- **Bold**: Heavy, confident typography, strong contrasts
- **Now + Next**: Grounded in Detroit's industrial present, gesturing toward a greener, regenerative future

## Visual Style

- Muted brick (`#b22222`, `#8b4513`)

**Textures:**
- Gritty, concrete surfaces
- Worn metal finishes
- Industrial grid patterns

**Iconography:**
- Gears and mechanical elements
- Grid systems and blueprints
- Wires and industrial infrastructure
- Machine lion (Crimea inspiration)

**Typeface:**
- Bold sans-serifs for headers
- Stencil-inspired accents
- Industrial, utilitarian feel

### Solarpunk Hints

**Palette Accents:**
- Electric green (`#00ff41`, `#32cd32`)
- Solar yellow (`#ffd700`, `#ffff00`)
- Glowing cyan (`#00ffff`, `#40e0d0`)

**Shapes & Elements:**
- Vines weaving through wires
- Plants cracking through pavement
- Nodes lighting up in network patterns
- Organic curves breaking through geometric grids

**Motion & Transitions:**
- Gradual fade from industrial "hard" imagery to solarpunk "soft" light/glow
- Progressive reveal of green/glowing elements as user scrolls
- Breathing animations on network nodes

## Visual Metaphors to Blend

### Garden / Growth
- Sprouting plants breaking through industrial textures
- Root systems overlaying circuit patterns
- Green shoots emerging from concrete cracks

### Network / Web
- Glowing node map of Detroit layered on industrial blueprint grids
- Connection lines that pulse with energy
- Community nodes that light up with activity

### Mechanical / Organic
- Gears with roots growing out of them
- Pipes overlaid with climbing vines
- Industrial structures softened by organic growth

## Detroit Identity

### Visual Anchors
- Russell Industrial Center energy: raw, industrial, mechanical creativity
- Crimea's machine lion as symbol of resilience + creativity
- Simplified logo/icon motifs derived from industrial Detroit

### Copy Tone
- Direct and confident
- Collective voice ("we", "us", "our")
- Proud of Detroit heritage
- Signature phrase: **"Detroit builds in the open."**

## Layout & Interaction Design

### Hero Section
- Big, bold headline against industrial-textured background
- Rust and steel color palette with subtle green accents
- Typography that feels stenciled or stamped

### Progressive Transitions
- **Start gritty**: Heavy industrial textures, muted colors
- **Introduce growth**: Green accents appear as user scrolls
- **End hopeful**: Solarpunk elements more prominent in later sections

### Dynamic Elements
- Network nodes pulsing faintly in background
- "Growing" animations as projects get added to the commons
- Subtle particle effects suggesting both sparks and seeds

## Emotional Target

When someone lands here, they should feel:

> **"This is Detroit â€” raw, creative, collective, and building the future from the ground up."**

### Key Emotional Beats
1. **Respect** for Detroit's industrial heritage
2. **Pride** in community building and collaboration
3. **Hope** for a regenerative, connected future
4. **Belonging** to something bigger than themselves

## Implementation Notes

### Color Usage Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Deep blacks and steel grays (foundation)
2. **Secondary**: Rust orange and muted brick (Detroit character)
3. **Accent**: Electric green and solar yellow (future hope)
4. **Highlight**: Glowing cyan (active/interactive elements)

### Animation Principles
- **Subtle by default**: Don't overwhelm the content
- **Purposeful motion**: Every animation should reinforce the theme
- **Performance conscious**: Smooth on all devices
- **Accessibility friendly**: Respect reduced motion preferences

### Responsive Considerations
- Industrial textures should remain visible on mobile
- Typography hierarchy must work at all sizes
- Green accents should be prominent enough on smaller screens
- Touch targets sized appropriately for mobile interaction
