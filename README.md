# 🌐 Detroit's OpenCommons

Detroit builds in the open.

The OpenCommons is a shared digital space where creators come together to connect, collaborate, and build. It's a public digital commons designed to empower Detroit's community by aligning scattered efforts, breaking down silos, and amplifying collective impact.

## ✨ Mission

To create and maintain an open digital commons that empowers Detroit's communities to:

- **Collaborate transparently**
- **Share resources and knowledge**
- **Build projects together**
- **Uplift one another through shared goals and values**

## 📜 Principles

- **Openness** – Contributions are visible, remixable, and free to build upon.
- **Transparency** – Decisions, processes, and resources are documented in public.
- **Collaboration** – Projects overlap and strengthen one another instead of existing in silos.
- **Accessibility** – The commons is inclusive and easy to join.
- **Shared Stewardship** – No single owner; the community collectively maintains and evolves the commons.

## 📍 Why Detroit?

Detroit is full of creative and technical energy. But efforts are often scattered, resources siloed, and opportunities missed. The OpenCommons provides a common ground for Detroit's builders and creators — starting here, replicable anywhere.

## 🛠️ What Lives in the Commons?

- **Open projects** (code, data, docs, designs)
- **Community knowledge** (guides, learnings, toolkits)
- **Collaboration protocols** (shared ways to work, govern, and share credit)
- **Transparency tools** (dashboards, open ledgers, participation records)

## 🚀 How to Get Involved

- 🔔 **Join the Commons** → Sign up for updates
- 🚀 **Submit a Project** → Share your idea
- 🛠️ **Join as a Builder** → Collaborate on projects

## 🌱 Long-Term Vision

Detroit's OpenCommons is the first node of a decentralized, community-owned network of digital commons. The goal is to create a replicable model — so any community, anywhere, can establish their own OpenCommons to support collaboration and shared ownership.
